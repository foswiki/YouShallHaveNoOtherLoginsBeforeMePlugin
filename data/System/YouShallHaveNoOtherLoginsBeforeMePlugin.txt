---++ Usage
This plugin works behind the scenes. There is no need to configure anything.  
You want to use this plugin, if you want to make sure, that a single user
is logged in only once. On each access this plugin checks, if there are 
other active sessions for the current user. If appropriate sessions are 
found, those are purged.

%X% Depending on the wikis load, there are alot of sessions to inspect.
The inspection is an expensive task.
